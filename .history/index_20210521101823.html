                <h1>Normal Flow</h1>
            </header>
            <p>This article explains normal flow, or the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you have not changed their
                layout.</p>
            <p>As detailed in the last lesson introducing layout, elements on a webpage lay out in the normal flow, if you have not
                applied any CSS to change the way they behave. And, as we began to discover, you can change how elements behave
                either by adjusting their position in that normal flow, or removing them from it altogether. Starting with a solid,
                well-structured document that is readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage. It ensures that your
                content is readable, even if the user is using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads
                out the content of the page. In addition, as normal flow is designed to make a readable document, by starting in
                this way you are working with the document rather than fighting against it as you make changes to the layout.</p>
            <p>Before digging deeper into different layout methods, it is worth revisiting some of the things you will have studied
                in previous modules with regard to normal document flow.</p>
            <h2>How are elements laid out by default?</h2>
            <p>First of all, individual element boxes are laid out by taking the elements' content, then adding any padding, border
                and margin around them — it's that box model thing again, which we've looked at earlier.
            </p>
            <p>By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it,
                and grows in the block dimension to accommodate its content. Inline elements are the size of their content. You
                can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements. If you want
                to control the size of an inline element in this manner, you need to set it to behave like a block level element
                with display: block; (or even,display: inline-block; which mixes characteristics from both.)
            </p>
            <p>That explains individual elements, but what about how elements interact with one another? The normal layout flow
                (mentioned in the layout introduction article) is the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's
                viewport. By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, based on the parent's writing
                mode (initial: horizontal-tb) — each one will appear on a new line below the last one, and they will be separated by
                any margin that is set on them. In English therefore, or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode,
                block-level elements are laid out vertically.
            </p>
            <p>Inline elements behave differently — they don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along
                with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content, as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the
                parent block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing text or elements will move down to a new
                line.
            </p>
            <p>If two adjacent elements both have the margin set on them and the two margins touch, the larger of the two remains,
                and the smaller one disappears — this is called margin collapsing, and we have met this before too.</p>
            <p>Let's look at a simple example that explains all of this:</p>
            <code><h1>Basic document flow</h1>

                <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>
                
                <p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>
                
                <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p>
                
                <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13360/long.jpg"></p></code>
            <code>body {
                width: 500px;
                margin: 0 auto;
              }
              
              p {
                background: rgba(255,84,104,0.3);
                border: 2px solid rgb(255,84,104);
                padding: 10px;
                margin: 10px;
              }
              
              span {
                background: white;
                border: 1px solid black;
              }</code>

                <h1>Flexbox</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.</p>
            <h2>Why Flexbox?</h2>
            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and positioning. These are fine, and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and frustrating.</p>
            <p>The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
                    <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>
            <h2>Specifying what elements to lay out as flexible boxes</h2>
            <code>section {
                display: flex;
              }</code>
